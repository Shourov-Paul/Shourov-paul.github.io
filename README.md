Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

After downloading/cloning the project, navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

This will install all required dependencies.

### 2️⃣ Start the Development Server

Once the installation is complete, start the server with:

```bash

### ⚠️ Important: Set Up Environment Variables
